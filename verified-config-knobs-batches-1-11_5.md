# 🧬 Genetics Simulation — Verified Configuration Knobs (Batches 1–11.5)

This document lists configuration values that have been **verified directly against the codebase**.

Each entry includes:
- **Label** (UI-facing)
- **Key** (config property name)
- **UI** status:
  - ✅ **UI** = currently exposed in `configMeta` (Config Panel)
  - ❌ **Hidden** = used by simulation code, but **not** exposed in `configMeta` yet
  - 🚫 **Excluded** = present in `configMeta`, but recommended **not** to expose because the game already has a top-level speed control
- **Verified behavior** (plain English)
- **Code** (primary module(s) where it is used)

> Scope covered: **Population & Spawning**, **Food Sources**, **Feeding/Drinking**, **Foraging/Perception/Memory**, and **Reproduction/Mate Seeking**.

---


## ⚠ UI typing warning (important for “Enabled” flags)

The current config panel parses all inputs as **numbers** (via `parseFloat`). Several feature flags in the sim are gated with checks like:

- `config.someFlag !== false`

That means setting a UI value to `0` does **not** disable the feature (`0 !== false` is true). Only a literal boolean `false` disables it.

This affects (verified so far):
- `creatureGrazeEnabled`
- `creatureHerdingTargetBlendEnabled`

**Recommendation for future UI work:** render these as real booleans (toggles) and write `true/false` into config, or change the gates to accept `0/1` explicitly.


## ⏱ Timing (excluded from config panel)

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Simulation ticks per second | `ticksPerSecond` | 🚫 Excluded | Controls internal tick rate (separate from the top-bar speed multiplier). Recommended to keep out of the config panel since you already have 1x/2x/4x speed. | `src/sim/config.js` (sim config) |

### Conception & gestation

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |

| Slow threshold (above) | `creatureBirthChildStartingMetersSlowIfMultiplierAbove` | ❌ Hidden | If `gestationMultiplier > threshold`, apply slow multiplier. | `reproduction.js` |

### Verified mate-finding mechanics (behavior notes, no knobs)

- If a creature can consider mating but no valid mate is within `creatureMateSeekRange`, it uses the **search goal** `mate` (same spiral/golden-angle exploration system as food/water) and sets intent to `seek` toward that exploration target.
- When a mate target exists, it is stored as `reproduction.mate.targetId` with a **commit timer**; the target is revalidated and only replaced when invalid or commit expires.
- Mate target selection chooses the **closest valid candidate** within range (uses spatial index if available for speed).

| Wander turn jitter (rad) | `creatureWanderTurnJitter` | ✅ UI | On wander retarget, heading is offset by `(rng*2-1)*jitter` radians (then boundary blending may modify). Default: 0.12 rad. | `movement.js` |
| In-herd heading bias | `creatureWanderInHerdHeadingBias` | ✅ UI | While “in herd”, blends base heading toward herd heading: `base = blendAngles(current, herd, bias)` before jitter is applied. Default: 0.65. | `movement.js` |
| In-herd retarget mult | `creatureWanderInHerdRetargetMultiplier` | ✅ UI | Multiplies wander min/max retarget times while in herd; higher = fewer retargets = tighter cohesion. Clamped 0.1–3.0. Default: 1.6. | `movement.js` |
| In-herd jitter mult | `creatureWanderInHerdJitterMultiplier` | ✅ UI | Multiplies wander jitter while in herd: `effectiveJitter = jitter * mult`. **Note:** code clamps mult to **0–1**, so values >1 have no effect currently. Default: 0.35. | `movement.js` |

## 🧭 Creatures — Target Following Steering (Batch 9.5)

Target-following applies when intent is a moving intent (e.g., `seek`, `mate`, `hunt`, patrol-like). Creatures do not move for `eat`, `drink`, or `rest`.

**Verified behavior notes (no knobs):**
- Water avoidance: if the next step lands in water, movement tries alternate headings (±45°, ±90°, ±135°) and uses the first non-water step; otherwise stays put.
- Target blending uses vector blending (not angle interpolation) to avoid wrap artifacts.

## 🌾 Creatures — Grazing Duty Cycle (Batch 10)

Grazing is a behavior layer that can replace `wander` with `graze` for herbivores who are comfortable and in a sufficiently large herd, producing an idle/move duty-cycle.

### Graze gating (intent selection)

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |

| Graze speed multiplier | `creatureGrazeSpeedMultiplier` | ✅ UI | While in the “move” phase of grazing, multiplies movement distance by this value (clamped 0–1). Default fallback: 0.35. | `movement.js` |

**Verified behavior notes (no knobs):**
- Grazing duty-cycle applies only when `intent.type === 'graze'` and the creature has no target (grazing never slows goal-following).
- Grazing intent activates only when a creature would otherwise wander, has no memory target, is not threatened, and is not a predator species.

|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Basal energy drain/s | `creatureBasalEnergyDrain` | ✅ UI | Every tick: `energy -= drain * (1/tps) * lifeStage.metabolismScale` (trait override supported). | `src/sim/creatures/metabolism.js` |
| Basal water drain/s | `creatureBasalWaterDrain` | ✅ UI | Every tick: `water -= drain * (1/tps) * lifeStage.metabolismScale` (trait override supported). | `metabolism.js` |
| Basal stamina drain/s | `creatureBasalStaminaDrain` | ❌ Hidden | Every tick: `stamina -= drain * (1/tps) * lifeStage.metabolismScale` (trait override supported). | `metabolism.js` |

### Sprint decision (hysteresis thresholds)

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Base stamina (max) | `creatureBaseStamina` | ❌ Hidden | Baseline “full stamina” cap used for ratios and regen clamp. | `metabolism.js`, `movement.js` |
| Sprint start threshold | `creatureSprintStartThreshold` | ❌ Hidden | If not sprinting: starts sprint when `staminaRatio >= start`. Trait override supported. | `metabolism.js` |
| Sprint stop threshold | `creatureSprintStopThreshold` | ❌ Hidden | If sprinting: continues while `staminaRatio > min(start, stop)`; safety clamp prevents inverted hysteresis. Trait override supported. | `metabolism.js` |

### Sprint effects (speed + costs)

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Sprint speed multiplier | `creatureSprintSpeedMultiplier` | ❌ Hidden | When sprinting, multiplies movement distance; trait override supported. Default in sim config: 1.7. | `src/sim/creatures/movement.js` |
| Sprint stamina drain/s | `creatureSprintStaminaDrain` | ✅ UI | If sprinting, each tick: `stamina -= drain * (1/tps) * lifeStage.metabolismScale` (in addition to basal stamina drain). Trait override supported. | `metabolism.js` |

### Stamina regeneration

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Stamina regen/s | `creatureStaminaRegen` | ✅ UI | If not sprinting: `stamina += regen*(1/tps)*lifeStage.metabolismScale`, clamped to `baseStamina`. Trait override supported. | `metabolism.js` |

**Verified behavior notes (no knobs):**
- Sprint is forced off while `intent.type` is `eat` or `drink`.

### Hunger/thirst gates

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Eat threshold | `creatureEatThreshold` | ❌ Hidden | `canEat = (energyRatio < threshold)`; influences priority and food intents. | `src/sim/creatures/intent.js` |
| Drink threshold | `creatureDrinkThreshold` | ❌ Hidden | `canDrink = (waterRatio < threshold) && hasNearbyWater`; influences priority and water intents. | `intent.js` |
| Drink concern margin | `creatureDrinkConcernMargin` | ✅ UI | Defines “concerned thirst” band: `min(0.98, drinkThreshold + margin)`; used to suppress optional behaviors when no water nearby. | `intent.js` |
| Need switch margin | `creatureNeedSwitchMargin` | ❌ Hidden | Priority hysteresis preventing rapid hunger↔thirst flipping when close. | `intent.js` |

### Restore knobs (close the loop)

| Label | Key | UI | Verified behavior | Code |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Drink amount | `creatureDrinkAmount` | ✅ UI | Restores water while drinking: `amount*(1/tps)` clamped to baseWater. | `src/sim/creatures/actions.js` |
| Eat amount | `creatureEatAmount` | ✅ UI | Consumes food at `amount*(1/tps)` and converts to energy using nutrition*efficiency. | `actions.js`, `src/sim/creatures/food.js` |
