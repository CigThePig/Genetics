# History (append-only)

- 2026-01-19 — Track 0 — Repo Bootstrap (Scaffolding) — Established Vite scaffolding with standard module stubs, Vitest smoke test, npm scripts, and GitHub Pages deployment config; documentation updated to match. Verification: npm run dev (timeout 5s), npm test, npm run build.
- 2026-01-19 — Track 1 — Developer Visibility & Control — Added FPS overlay + toggle, play/pause/step/speed UI shell, seeded RNG module, and determinism smoke test; repo-map validated for new modules. Verification: npm test.
- 2026-01-20 — Track 2 — Canvas + Camera + Inspection Skeleton — Added canvas renderer with touch camera, inspector stub, metrics panel shell, settings persistence, and worker-ready sim stub; wiring updated for new systems. Verification: Manual pan/zoom, tap inspector output, metrics panel visible, settings persist on refresh, app boots without worker.
- 2026-01-21 — Track 3 — World Grid & Terrain Foundations — Added deterministic world grid, blob terrain generation with effects table, terrain rendering, and water/shore corridors with distinct palette. Verification: Manual terrain repeatability by seed, terrain effects lookup, water/shore visibility.
- 2026-01-21 — Track 4 — Plant Economy: Grass, Stress, Bushes, Berries — Added grass regrowth with stress, bush entities with berry pools, and plant metrics for observability. Verification: Manual grass regrowth, stress recovery, and bush/berry metrics updates.
- 2026-01-21 — Track 5 — Plant Economy: Recovery, Rendering, Metrics — Added bush recovery and berry regeneration tied to health, terrain-aware grass/bush seeding, plant rendering, and expanded plant metrics with hotspot validation. Verification: Manual plant recovery/regen observations, plant rendering review, hotspot seed validation, and berry/health metric changes.
- 2026-01-21 — Track 6 — Creature Core: Meters, Stages, Movement — Added creature model with meters, life stage scaling, basal metabolism drains, terrain-friction movement, and thirst/hunger priority inspection. Verification: npm test.
- 2026-01-19 — Track 6.5 — Canon Lock + Species Retrofit — Locked canonical species + ecosystem definitions, added deterministic species assignment and observability (renderer/inspector/metrics), and aligned docs to single canon source. Verification: npm test.
- 2026-01-23 — Track 7 — Survival Actions + Sprinting + Death — Added drink/eat behaviors (circles eat grass), stamina-driven sprinting, death conditions with causes, and population counters surfaced in metrics/UI. Verification: Manual observation of drink/eat/sprint behaviors, population changes, and death cause metrics.
- 2026-01-24 — Track 8 — Food Web + Perception + Memory — Added canonical diet/food properties, digestive efficiency biases, perception + alertness, and memory-driven seek behavior with inspector readouts. Verification: Manual observation of foraging styles and memory entries in inspector.
- 2026-01-25 — Track 9 — Predation + Chase Dynamics — Added deterministic predator target scoring, stamina-gated chase loop with loss rules, and chase observability in metrics/inspector. Verification: npm test; manual observation of chase arcs and target selection logic.
