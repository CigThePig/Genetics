One sentence:
- A mobile-first browser simulation where evolution emerges from ecology, terrain, predation, mate choice, and universal color perception.

Non-negotiable pillars:
- Evolution is emergent (genes → phenotype → survival/reproduction → inheritance + mutation).
- No free stats (every improvement increases cost or vulnerability elsewhere).
- Chases matter (multi-hit HP, stamina gating, alertness gating reaction/evasion).
- The map matters (terrain + water + plants create hotspots, routes, ambush patterns).
- Color is universal (evolving body color + mate preference; species-specific perception; affects mating and detection).

“Feels like evolution” requires observability:
- Population counts per species over time
- Trait distributions over time (not just averages)
- Color distributions over time (body + mate preference)
- Causes of death (starvation, thirst, predation, age)
- Creature inspection explaining current state/needs/threats/targets

Out of scope early:
- Fancy art/polish
- Multiplayer/server features
- Deep strategic AI beyond reactive + memory-driven behavior
