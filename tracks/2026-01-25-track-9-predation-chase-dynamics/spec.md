# Track 9 — Predation + Chase Dynamics

Goal:

- Make chases matter before combat exists by adding deterministic target scoring and a stamina-aware chase loop.

Included Steps (from Track Index):

1. Target scoring (Triangles hunt Circles/Octagons; Octagons hunt Squares)
2. Chase loop (stamina + losing target)

Acceptance:

- Predator behavior creates chase arcs and stragglers.

Risks:

- Predator selection feels random.
- Pursuit stability causes constant target loss.

Verification:

- Manual: observe consistent target choice logic.
- Metrics: chase attempts and outcomes recorded.
