# Track 5 — Plant Economy: Recovery, Rendering, Metrics

## Goal
Make plant dynamics visible and tunable so players can see hotspots, recovery cycles, and berry availability evolve over time.

## Includes (from Track Index)
1) Bush recovery
2) Berry regeneration tied to bush health
3) Plant rendering
4) Plant metrics
5) “Known seed” hotspot validation

## Acceptance
- Berry hotspots cycle instead of infinite growth.
- Metrics show plant state clearly.
- Known seed produces visible hotspots.

## Risks
- Visuals fail to communicate plant state.
- Metrics too noisy or expensive.

## Verification
- Manual: hotspot seed produces repeatable pattern.
- Metrics: berry totals and bush health change over time.
