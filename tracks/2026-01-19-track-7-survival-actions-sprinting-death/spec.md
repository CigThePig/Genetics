# Track 7 — Survival Actions + Sprinting + Death

Goal:
- The loop becomes “alive.”

Includes (Steps 31–35):
1) Drinking behavior
2) Grass eating (Circles only)
3) Stamina + sprinting
4) Death conditions
5) Population counters

Acceptance:
- Creatures can live/die based on meters and environment.
- Counters reflect births/deaths (births may be placeholder until Track 10).
- Canonical species are assumed and referenced from context/architecture.md.

Risks:
- Death spiral from poorly tuned drains.
- Sprint logic dominates movement.

Verification:
- Manual: creatures drink/eat appropriately.
- Metrics: population changes and death causes recorded.
