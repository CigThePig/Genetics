# Track 4 — Plant Economy: Grass, Stress, Bushes, Berries

## Goal
Create the ecological “heartbeat” by implementing grass regrowth with stress dynamics and adding bush entities with berries.

## Includes (Steps 16–20)
1. Grass regrowth to cap.
2. Diminishing regrowth near cap.
3. Overgrazing stress.
4. Stress recovery.
5. Bush entities + berry pool.

## Acceptance
- Grass cycles and stress is observable.
- Bushes exist and have health + berries.

## Risks
- Regrowth feels too fast or collapses too easily.

## Verification
- Manual: watch grass recover and stress respond.
- Metrics: grass average and stressed cells update.
