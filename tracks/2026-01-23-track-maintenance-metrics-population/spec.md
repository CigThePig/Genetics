# Maintenance Track — Metrics Population Display

Goal:
- Expose creature population counts in the Metrics panel UI.

Includes:
- Add a creature population metric definition in the UI metrics list.
- Format and display creature count values alongside existing plant metrics.
- Optional: add a "Population" header in the Metrics panel for clarity.

Acceptance:
- Metrics panel shows a "Creatures" row with current count.
- Values are formatted consistently with other metrics.
- Optional population header does not disrupt existing layout.

Risks:
- UI label mismatch or missing formatting for the new metric.

Verification:
- Manual: confirm creature count appears and updates alongside plant metrics.
