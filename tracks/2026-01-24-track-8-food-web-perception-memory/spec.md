# Track 8 — Food Web + Perception + Memory

Goal:
- Turn wandering dots into ecology participants by adding canonical food logic, perception, alertness, and memory that drive differentiated foraging styles.

Included Steps (from Track Index):
1) Canonical diet ranking + fallback rules (Squares/Triangles/Circles/Octagons)
2) Food properties (nutrition/handling/risk) aligned to canon resources
3) Digestive efficiency biases (canon anti-omnivore rules)
4) Perception v1 (sight + terrain)
5) Alertness + reaction delay
6) Memory records (food/water/danger/mate spots)
7) Scout vs route-runner emergence

Acceptance:
- Distinct foraging styles emerge.
- Threat response begins to feel real.

Risks:
- Perception too strong/weak causing unrealistic behaviors.
- Memory becomes too heavy computationally.

Verification:
- Manual: observe scouts vs route runners.
- Inspector: memory entries visible (summary).
